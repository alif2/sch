# sch

sch is a Linux task scheduler created for an operating systems class that can create and manage worker threads to schedule them using the requested scheduling paradigm.

Much of this code has been provided by the professor for this project, including the test and list files and the structure for the worker and scheduler files. Many, but not all pieces of original code are marked by TODO comments in scheduler.c and worker.c
